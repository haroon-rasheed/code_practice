EasyInstall is a package manager for the Python programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Python programs and libraries (based on the Python Eggs wrapper). easy_install is a module bundled with setuptools, a third-party library meant to enhance the Python standard library's distutils (Distribution utilities).[1] It is analogous to RubyGems for the Ruby programming language.
By default, EasyInstall looks in the Python Package Index (PyPI) for the desired packages and uses the metadata there to download and install the package and its dependencies. It is also hosted itself on the PyPI.
Python Eggs are a way of bundling additional information with a Python project, that allows the project's dependencies to be checked and satisfied at runtime, as well as allowing projects to provide plugins for other projects.
EasyInstall is not a fully fledged package manager. It cannot list local packages nor update them all. Pip and distribute are Python applications designed to fulfil the same role as easy_install. Distribute was created specifically due to the lack of progress in easy_install development. [2]
